## Choose proper version numbers

Follow [semantic versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) for versioning your project (major.minor.patch). Update the version number in your [meta.json](/workflow-store/#2-add-meta-information), [CITATION.cff](/workflow-store/#4-add-a-license-optional), [setup.py](../package), etc. files when releasing a new version. Then [create a new tag and release](/workflow-store/#6-create-a-releasetag) and [upload it to the workflow store](/workflow-store/#7-upload-to-the-workflow-store).
